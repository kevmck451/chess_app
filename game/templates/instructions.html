    <h1>How to Play Chess</h1>
    <p>Chess is a classic two-player strategy board game that requires careful planning and strategic thinking. Here are the basic rules and instructions to get you started:</p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>The objective of chess is to checkmate your opponent's king. This means putting the opponent's king in a position where it cannot escape capture.</p>

    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <p>1. The chessboard consists of 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid.</p>
    <p>2. Each player starts with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.</p>
    <p>3. The pieces are set up as follows:</p>
    <pre>
    -----------------------------------------
    | r | n | b | q | k | b | n | r |   | 8
    -----------------------------------------
    | p | p | p | p | p | p | p | p |   | 7
    -----------------------------------------
    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | 6
    -----------------------------------------
    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | 5
    -----------------------------------------
    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | 4
    -----------------------------------------
    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | 3
    -----------------------------------------
    | P | P | P | P | P | P | P | P |   | 2
    -----------------------------------------
    | R | N | B | Q | K | B | N | R |   | 1

    <h2>Basic Moves</h2>
    <p>1. <strong>Pawns</strong> move forward one square but capture diagonally. On their first move, pawns can move two squares forward.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Rooks</strong> can move horizontally or vertically any number of squares.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Knights</strong> move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular to that. Knights can jump over other pieces.</p>
    <p>4. <strong>Bishops</strong> move diagonally any number of squares.</p>
    <p>5. <strong>Queens</strong> can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally any number of squares.</p>
    <p>6. <strong>Kings</strong> can move one square in any direction.</p>

    <h2>Special Moves</h2>
    <p>1. <strong>Castling:</strong> A special move involving the king and one of the rooks, which allows the king to move two squares towards a rook while the rook moves to the square the king skipped over. Castling is only allowed under certain conditions.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>En Passant:</strong> A pawn capture that occurs when a pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position and lands beside an opponent's pawn. The opponent's pawn can capture the moving pawn as if it had only moved one square forward.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Pawn Promotion:</strong> When a pawn reaches the opponent's back rank (8th rank for white, 1st rank for black), it can be promoted to any other piece (except a king), usually a queen.</p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>Players take turns to make a single move, starting with white. The game continues until one player's king is checkmated, resulting in victory for the other player, or a draw (stalemate or insufficient material).</p>

    <h2>Now You're Ready to Play!</h2>
    <p>Chess is a game of strategy, tactics, and planning. It may take time to master, but with practice, you'll become a skilled chess player. Enjoy your games of chess!</p>
